Conducting such events are also very expensive and time consuming for the event organizer.

The main objectives of this project are to provide a safe way to conduct auctions in the pandemic. conducting offline auctions can be very expensive for the organizers, through this project they can conduct the auction in a very cost effective and eco friendly way. This project aims to deliver the same cricket auction like feeling in a virtual platform so that cricket fans are not disappointed.

The user will be able to enroll a player for auction. Every time a player is registered, the player name and the base price will be asked. The user will also be able to register a team which will take part in the auction. Every time a team is registered, the team will be given a purse value of 50 crores for the auction. When the auction starts all the teams will asked to bid for all the players one by one. The team with the maximum bid will own the player. If no team bids for a particular player then that player will be termed as unsold. Every time a player or a team is created, an object is created.
